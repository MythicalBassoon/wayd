## Usage

Users can input their current location or a specific location of their choice and receive a psuedo-random event in the area. Details and map information are provided for each event. If they don't like the event given to them, they can continue generating different events in the area. 

Users will also be able to send a poll to their friends from the app, allowing for group voting on the event to see if its something everyone wants to attend. The user themself and their friends will be able to vote in the email and confirmation emails will be sent out once everyone has voted.

### Installing Dependencies

From the root folder of the repo:

```sh
npm install
```

From the post-install folder:
- Grab/Copy the 'apikeys.js' file into 'root'/Server/Workers & 'root'/Server/Controllers/ & 'root'
or run the following commands from the post-install folder:

```sh
cp apikeys.js ../Server/Workers/
cp apikeys.js ../Server/Controllers/
cp apikeys.js ../

NOTE: You must provide your own API keys for the keys indicated in apikeys.js

- Grab/Copy the rest of the folders within the post-install folder and paste them into the node_module directory:

```sh
yes | cp -rf react-native-maps/* ../node_modules/react-native-maps/
yes | cp -rf react-native-google-places-autocomplete/* ../node_modules/react-native-google-places-autocomplete/
yes | cp -rf react/* ../node_modules/react/
yes | cp -rf react-native/* ../node_modules/react-native/


```

NOTE: You must replace the entire folder found in node_modules with the folders found in the post-install folder as shown above. Otherwise, the project will silently not compile or will encounter errors during simulation.
